/** RTPSession derived class that serves as a base class for an SRTP implementation.
 *  
 *  This is an RTPSession derived class that serves as a base class for an SRTP implementation.
 *  The class sets the RTPSession::SetChangeIncomingData and RTPSession::SetChangeOutgoingData
 *  flags, and implements RTPSession::OnChangeIncomingData, RTPSession::OnChangeRTPOrRTCPData
 *  and RTPSession::OnSentRTPOrRTCPData so that encryption and decryption is applied to packets.
 *  The encryption and decryption will be done using [libsrtp](https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp),
 *  which must be available at compile time.
 *
 *  Your derived class should call RTPSecureSession::InitializeSRTPContext to initialize a context
 *  struct of `libsrtp`. When this succeeds, the context can be obtained and used with the
 *  RTPSecureSession::LockSRTPContext function, which also locks a mutex if thread support was
 *  available. After you're done using the context yourself (to set encryption parameters for
 *  SSRCs), you **must** release it again using RTPSecureSession::UnlockSRTPContext.
 *
 *  See `example7.cpp` for an example of how to use this class.
