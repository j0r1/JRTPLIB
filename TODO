For v3:
 * experiment with srtp
 * get rid of abort descriptors, try to  use the existing rtp/rtcp sockets for this
 * Look into bug here lastmsgtime = srcdat->INF_GetLastMessageTime() was somehow 
   negative
 * Port 0 chooses a port itself
 * MingW support
 * Expose GetSequenceNumber for the RTP seq nr
 * send raw data


For v4:
 * introduce a basic transmitter which does not have things like a destination list,
   ignore list, accept list
 * similarly: create a basic rtpsession class
 * don't order accepted rtp packets anymore, don't look for duplicates
 * use an abstract timer object, possibly high performance and not affected by
   clock jumps
