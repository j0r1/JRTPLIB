				-----------------
 3.11.2 (April 2020):
 	* Taking EINTR in nanosleep, poll and select calls into account.
	  Thanks to Filippo Guerzoni (filippo.guerzoni@gmail.com) for bringing
	  this to my attention.
	* Disabled some copy constructors
	* Bugfix in RTPExternalTransmitter: a buffer could fill up causing the
	  an operation to fail to get aborted
	* Added constructor to RTPRawPacket to guess RTP/RTCP type
	* Bugfixed regarding some calles being cut short due to an EINTR

 3.11.1 (March 2017)
 	* Bugfix in rtpsources.cpp: if the RTP packet got deleted in
	  OnValidatedRTPPacket, then an illegal address would be accessed
	  when looking up the CSRC identifiers. Thanks to Lau Bakman for
	  reporting this.

 3.11.0 (March 2017)
	* In the RTPSession class, thread safety can be requested even
	  if the poll thread is not used.
	* Moved the 'abort decriptor' stuff into a separate class and 
	  made it possible for the UDPv4 transmitter to use a pre-created 
	  instance. In turn this allows a single poll thread to be set up
	  for multiple RTPSession instances. Example8 illustrates this.
	* Made an abstraction RTPSelect for the 'select' call. This can
	  use 'poll' or 'WSAPoll' depending on the availabity, which can
	  allow better scaling for a use case such as example8.
	* Added RTPRandom::CreateDefaultRandomNumberGenerator to create
	  the default random number engine for the platform in use.
	* When using gcc, warnings will be treated as error by default
	  (this can be disabled in the cmake options)
	* Added a transmission component that allows packets to be sent
	  and received over TCP.

 3.10.0 (December 2016)
	* Support for MingW compilation was added
	* Outgoing data or incoming data can be intercepted and changed
	  (useful for encryption)
	* SRTP support (using libsrtp) through the RTPSecureSession class.
	  Thanks to Vladimir V. Pavluk (vladvic_r@mail.ru) and to
	  Alexey Obergan (alex.obergan@gmail.com) for providing very helpful 
	  code.
	* RTP packets can now be processed in RTPSession's
	  OnValidatedRTPPacket virtual function.
	* Various virtual function were added to the RTPSession class to
	  get immediate notification of RTCP sender reports, receiver
	  reports, SDES data.
	* Support for RTP and RTCP multiplexing over the same port, for the
	  UDPv4 transmitter.
	* Added a member function to RTPSession to send raw data, i.e. to
	  send data directly over the RTP or RTCP channel of the transmitter.
	* Added a member function to RTPSession by which you can retrieve the
	  next RTP sequence number.
	* Specifying port 0 for the UDPv4 transmitter chooses a port pair
	  by itself.
	* The UDPv4 transmitter can be initialized using pre-created RTP
	  and RTCP sockets.
	* Modified RTPTime class to use an internal representation of a
	  double precision floating point number. Also using clock_gettime
	  if available instead of gettimeofday, to obtain times that are
	  not affected by clock adjustments.

 3.9.2 (December 2016)
 	* Major bugfix: zero length UDP packets should no longer block
	  the reception of packets.
	* Various compiler warnings were fixed. Thanks to Ruotger Skupin
	  (roddi@me.com) for supplying the patch.

 3.9.1 (November 2011)
 	* Fixed a bug in the CMake configuration: was unable to handle
	  path names with spaces.
	* Fixed bug in rtcpsdespacket.h: end namespace curly bracket
	  was in wrong place.
	* In an MS-Windows environment you can now choose to build a
	  DLL instead of a static library.

 3.9.0 (July 2011)
	* Switched to CMake build system.
	* Added the RTPByteAddress class, which can be used to describe
	  a host/port combination in a very general way.
	* Added the RTPExternalTransmitter class which can be used if
	  one would like to use a transmission mechanism other than
	  the UDP based transmitters.
	* Placed everything in namespace 'jrtplib'.

 3.8.2 (February 2011)
 	* Fixed bug in RTPRandomRand48. The uint16_t version used a
	  & 0xff instead of & 0xffff. Thanks to Alexey Kumkov
	  (crazykum@ukr.net) for bringing this to my attention.

 3.8.1 (October 2010)
 	* Initialization of the RTPRandomRandS class didn't work as
	  intended, causing the fall-back class RTPRandomRand48 always
	  being used on the Win32 platform.

 3.8.0 (September 2010)
 	* Fixed bug in RTPSources implementation. An incorrect 
	  'GotoNextElement' call was replaced by a 'GotoPreviousElement'
	  call.
	* Added functionality to send unknown RTCP packets. Patch
	  was supplied by Tom Harper (d.thomas.harper@gmail.com)
	* Fixed bug in INF_GetEstimatedTimestampUnit (possibility of
	  division by zero). Thanks to Gilson Yi (gilson.yi@gmail.com)
	  for bringing this to my attention.
	* Added some code to allow a specific SSRC to be used.
	* Fixed bug in jitter calculation code. Thanks to Uwe Andersen
	  (uandersen@mayah.com) for bringing this to my attention.
	* Added OnPollThreadStart and OnPollThreadStop to RTPSession.
	  Thanks to Daniele Barzotti (daniele.barzotti@eurocomtel.com)
	  for suggesting this.
	* Added method to RTPSessionParams to force a specific CNAME.
	  Thanks to Lars Rohwedder (L.Rohwedder@mocotec.de) for the
	  suggestion.
	* Removed old RTPRandom code and made RTPRandom an abstract
	  interface. Added a /dev/urandom implementation, a rand_s
	  implementation and a rand48 implementation. By default, 
	  /dev/urandom and rand_s are tried, and rand48 is used as a 
	  fall-back mechanism.

 3.7.1 (May 2007)
 	* Fixed bug in the CurrentTime implementation (Win32/WinCE version). 
	  Thanks to Dani Baeyens (dani@warp.es) and Eric Johnson 
	  (EJohnson@pelco.com) for helping me solve this problem.

 3.7.0 (January 2007)
 	* Send and receive socket buffer sizes can now be set in the
	  transmission parameters. Thanks to Dmitry Shandyba
	  (Dmitry.Shandyba@materialise.kiev.ua) for suggesting this.
	* Changed a 'htons' call to a 'ntohs' call in ShouldAcceptData
	  in both the IPv4 and IPv6 transmitters.
	* Fixed bug in RTPIPv6Destination. Thanks to Yi-Huan Chan
	  (yhchan@csie.nctu.edu.tw) and Franco Sinhori 
	  (francosinhori@gmail.com) for bringing this to my attention.

 3.6.0 (June 2006)
	* Added a constructor to the RTCPCompoundPacket class to be able
	  to parse a compound packet out of a byte array (and not only
	  out of an RTPRawPacket instance).
	* Added a method to RTPSession to send RTCP APP packets. Thanks
	  to Herman Bastiaens (herman.bastiaens@student.uhasselt.be)
	  for supplying the patch.
	* Fixed Win32 rand_s bug. Thanks to Jeremy Noring
	  (jnoring@wilife.com) for supplying the patch.
	* Removed the GetNumRTPPacketsSent and GetNumRTCPPacketsSent
	  functions in the transmitter. The counts were only used to
	  check if packets had been sent. Now, a flag in RTPSession is
	  used for this purpose.
	* Added memory management support.
	* Added a member function to RTPSession which allows passing an
	  RTPTransmitter instance. 
	* The instances in the destination lists now store struct
	  sockaddr variables. This makes sending data to each destination
	  more efficient.

 3.5.2 (March 2006)
 	* Fixed bug in the random number functions which are used with
	  MS Visual Studio 2005. Thanks to Jun Ohasi (jun@jnb.odn.ne.jp)
	  for bringing the incorrect use of rand_s to my attention.
	* Changed types like u_int32_t to types like uint32_t in the 
	  documentation.

 3.5.1 (March 2006)
	* Fixed bug in RTCP scheduler. Due to -= operation on an RTPTime
	  instance, an incredibly large scheduling interval could be
	  calculated.

 3.5.0 (March 2006)
 	* Now, the define RTP_SNPRINTF is used instead of snprintf,
	  _snprintf or _snprintf_s.
	* In the RTPSources member function MultipleTimeouts, I neglected
	  to call the OnRemoveSource virtual function. Thanks to Adam Love 
	  (alove@exceptionalinnovation.com) for bringing this to my attention.
	* Added a OnSendRTCPCompoundPacket member function to the RTPSession
	  class. Useful for inspecting outgoing data.
	* Modified the templates somewhat. Should cause less compiler problems
	  this way. Thanks tot Chris Hamilton (chamilton@cs.dal.ca) for 
	  providing this solution.
	* On Win32, if possible the functions rand_s and srand_s are now used.

 3.4.0 (January 2006)
 	* Changed u_int32_t like types to uint32_t like types. Thanks to
	  Panagiotis Issaris (takis.issaris@uhasselt.be) for informing me
	  that these are C99 compliant.
	* Changed sprintf functions to safer snprintf functions. Thanks to
	  Panagiotis Issaris (takis.issaris@uhasselt.be) for pointing this
	  out.
	* Fixed bug in RTPSources (counters were not reset when the source
	  table was cleared). Thanks to Justin Matthews (jmatthewsr@yahoo.com)
	  for pointing this out.
	* Fixed bug in RTPHashTable and RTPKeyHashTable. Thanks to 
	  Tom Pijsel (tom.pijsel@twelvecubes.com) for bringing this to my
	  attention.
	* Fixed bug in example3.cpp

 3.3.0 (October 2005)
 	* Now it is possible to use a user-defined transmission component.
	* Added GStreamer transmission component written by Philippe Khalaf
	  (burger@speedy.org).

 3.2.1 (September 2005)
 	* The library wouldn't compile when probation support was disabled. 
	  Thanks to Herman Bastiaens (herman.bastiaens@student.luc.ac.be) for
	  bringing this to my attention.
	* When parsed from an RTPRawPacket, the receive time is also stored
	  in the RTPPacket instance.

 3.2.0 (September 2005)
 	* Modified the routine in the RTPSession class which creates the
	  CNAME. Aparently on some systems, the 'getlogin' call returns
	  null. As an alternative, the library uses getenv("LOGNAME").
	  Thanks to Mark Schiffmann (schima@neumann-elektronik.com) for
	  mentioning this to me.
	* Added a OnBYEPacket method to the RTPSession class. Thanks to
	  Sigrid Thijs (sthijs@androme.be) for suggesting this.
	* When probation support is enabled, a probation type can be selected
	  when the session is created. Supported types are "No probation",
	  "Use probation, but store packets" and "Use probation and discard
	  packets received in probation mode". Thanks to Chris Flerackers
	  (cflerackers@androme.be) for suggesting this feature.
	* Added a parameter to WaitForIncomingData which indicates if
	  data is available when the function returns. Based on a suggestion
	  by Uwe Andersen (uandersen@mayah.com).
	* Now using getifaddrs (if possible) to obtain our own IP addresses
	  (both in IPv4 version and IPv6 version).
	* IPv6 code in Win32 version now works, but Visual Studio 2005 beta
	  has to be used. Thanks to Yi-Huan Chan (yhchan@csie.nctu.edu.tw)
	  for contributing some code.
	* Added Win32 code for GetLocalIPList_Interfaces (both IPv4 and IPv6).
	  Thanks to Ivan Makushkin (camry@pisem.net) for pointing out how
	  this could be done.
	* Added an option to use a SR packet when sending a BYE message.
	  Previously, a RR packet was always used, even if a session is
	  actually an active sender of data. Thanks to Uwe Andersen
	  (uandersen@mayah.com) for bringing this to my attention.
	* Fixed bug in CNAME creation.
	* Added WinCE support. Thanks to Maarten Daniels 
	  (maarten.daniels@uhasselt.be) for supplying patches.
	* Changed the CurrentTime implementation for the MS-Windows version.
	  Thanks to Maarten Daniels (maarten.daniels@uhasselt.be) and Chris
	  Flerackers (cflerackers@androme.be).

 3.1.0 (October 2004)
 	* Added a callback OnPollThreadStep which is called at the end of 
	  each loop of the poll thread
	* Added the examples subdirectory to the package
	* Fixed bug in rtpudpv4transmitter.cpp and rtpudpv6transmitter.cpp
	  which caused an infinite loop in LeaveAllMulticastGroups. Thanks
	  to Stijn Agten (stijn.agten@luc.ac.be) for pointing this out.
	* Added a function GetTransmissionInfo to the RTPTransmitter class
	  (and subclasses). The function will return some additional
	  information about the transmitter, like local IP addresses and
	  socket descriptors.

 3.0.2 (September 2004)
 	* Bugfix in rtpinternalsourcedata.cpp. The bug caused a crash when
	  duplicate packets were received. Thanks to Dominique Prunier
	  (dominique.prunier@micromedia-int.com) for informing me about
	  this.

 3.0.1 (September 2004)
 	* Bugfix in rtpudpv4transmitter.cpp and rtpudpv6transmitter.cpp in
	  method SetReceiveMode
	* Removed unused 'acceptownpackets' variable from
	  rtpudpv4transmitter.cpp and rtpudpv6transmitter.cpp
	* Added a 'Dump' function (for debugging) in RTPUDPv4Transmitter
	  and RTPUDPv6Transmitter
	* Now using JThread 1.1.0

 3.0.0 (August 2004)
 	* Complete rewrite of the library to provide better extensibility
	  and compliance with RFC 3550
	* Changes from the 2.x series:
		- The 2.x series was created with the idea that the user 
		  would only need to use the RTPSession class which meant 
		  that the other classes were not very useful by themselves. 
		  This version on the other hand, aims to provide many 
		  useful components to aid the user in building RTP capable 
		  applications.
		- In this version, the code which is specific for the 
		  underlying protocol by which RTP packets are transported, 
		  is bundled in a class which inherits its interface from a 
		  class called RTPTransmitter. This makes it easy for 
		  different underlying protocols to be supported. Currently 
		  there is support for UDP over IPv4 and UDP over IPv6.

 2.9 (July 2004)
 	* Fixed bug in rtpsrclist.cpp. Thanks to Lukasz Bobowiec 
	  (bobowiec@icslab.agh.edu.pl)
	* Added function in RTPSourceData which returns the IP address
	* Changed the random routines. Thanks to Jaap Keuter
	  (jaap.keuter@xs4all.nl)
	* Made the shared library link against libstdc++ if possible.
	  Thanks to Anatoly Yakovenko (aeyakovenko@yahoo.com) for the
	  suggestion.

 2.8 (January 2004)
 	* Added code to avoid a crash when receiving a malformed packet
	* Fixed a memory leak (forgot to free memory when a malformed
	  packet was discarded)
	* Changed debug routines for memory tracking

 2.7b (November 2003)
 	* Only added --enable-fpic and --enable-fPIC to the configure script

 2.7 (December 2002)
 	* Fixed important bug in rtpsources.cpp. This bug could cause
	  source information to get lost and could create a memory leak.
	* Improved support for AIX in multicasting code (uses _AIX define). 
	  Thanks to Klaus Matuschek (klaus.matuschek@infonova.com)
	* Fixed possible buffer overrun in rtpcontributingsources.cpp

 2.6 (January 2002)
	* This release only contains some minor changes
	* An 'install' target was added to the Makefile
	* Some newlines were added add the end of certain files to avoid
	  compiler warnings
	* Improved the jitter calculations somewhat 

 2.5 (December 2000)
 	* Added the possibility for the user to receive the raw RTCP packets.
	* Fixed a bug in RTPContributingSources::CreateLocalCNAME(). In this
	  routine, the wrong length was passed to 'gethostname'. Thanks to
	  Sergey V.Shpital (sergey@page.net.ru) for bringing this to my
	  attention.
	* Added a routine to set the Type of Service (ToS) field of the
	  outgoing packets (both RTP and RTCP). Thank to Philippe Cardon
	  (philippe.cardon@bt.com) for writing this code.
	* Fixed a bug in the 'packets lost' calculation. Thank to Domingo 
	  Cuevas Jr. (dcj@onebox.com) for helping me find this bug.
	* Fixed a bug in the sequence number and jitter calculation: when
	  packets were received out of order, the sequence numbers and
	  jitter got messed up. Many thanks to Mohammad Tawsheeq Russool 
	  (m.russool@eim.surrey.ac.uk) for helping me track down these
	  bugs.
	* Added the possibility to set the timestamp unit for a particular
	  source. Previously, it was assumed that their timestamp unit
	  was the same as that of the local session.

 2.4 (July 2000)
 	* Fixed a bug which caused all CSRS's except one to be incorrect.
 	* Added RTP header extension support (for both sending and receiving).
 	* Added some things (which should have been there already) to
 	  RTPPacket.
 	* Adjusted the way in which the login name is retrieved on unix-like
 	  systems. First I used a call to 'getlogin', but apparently this
 	  function messes with timers through the use of 'alarm' calls (at
 	  least on Linux). Now, I use a combination of 'geteuid' and
 	  'getpwuid' to obtain the necessary information. This does not
 	  have that problem and is a lot cleaner since it doesn't depend
 	  on login info (utmp) like 'getlogin'. Thanks to Roberto Jung Drebes
 	  (drebes@inf.ufrgs.br) for pointing out the timer-problem.
 	* Made a LaTeX version of the manual and tutorial. Looks a lot nicer.
 	* Made it possible for the user to specify the local IP address
 	  instead of letting the library figure it out itself.
 	* Fixed a bug which caused the 'fraction lost' in a RR packet to be
 	  zero all the time. Thanks to Domingo Cuevas Jr. (dcj@onebox.com) for
 	  pointing this out.
 	* Rewrote the RTCP packet sending routines. Now, they are much cleaner
 	  and much more understandable :)
 	* Added better support for RTCP 'APP' packets. You can now both send
 	  and receive APP packets.

 2.3 (April 2000)
 	* The routine which creates and sends RTCP packets is now a bit faster.
 	* Added a sample that demonstrates the round-trip time function.
 	* Added functions to RTPSourceData: now the time when the last RR or
 	  SR report was received can be retrieved. Also, the round trip time
 	  can be retrieved: this is calculated as suggested in RFC 1889.
 	* Fixed a bug: the LSR value was not calculated correctly, now it is
 	  (or should be ;-) )
 	* Instead of specifying defines on the command line, they are now
 	  defined in a config file. The unix version of this file is created
 	  by the configure script.
 	* Added a member to RTPPacket which I had forgotten (the payload type,
 	  which is obviously important :-) ).
 	* The library should now be able to work on a VxWorks platform. Thanks
 	  to Dave Osborne (dosborne@argoneng.com) for his help.
	* Added a tutorial and a small example application.
 	* Added some debugging routines (RTPDebug class) to check for memory
 	  leaks. It turned out that there weren't any, so I'm pretty pleased ;)
 	* I've added a 'configure' script to make compilation a bit easier
 	  across different platforms. Thanks to Qi Han (qh1c4@mizzou.edu) for
 	  helping me to improve the support for the Solaris platform. Also
 	  many thanks to Dario Maggiorini (dario@netdev.usr.dsi.unimi.it) for
 	  helping me test the script on several platforms.
 	* Added multicasting support.
	* A bug in rtpsourcedata.cpp was pointed out and fixed by Ramon Clout
	  (ramonc@win.tue.nl). Many thanks for this, Ramon.

 2.2 (February 2000)
 	* Extra support for Sun and HP. Thanks to Henry Lau (hlau@nuera.com)
 	  and Justin Matthews (jmatthews@nuera.com) for this information.
 	* The 'Poll' routine in rtpconnection.cpp has been altered. Now, the
 	  routine should work even if there's that ioctl bug (previously, this
 	  bug was only taken into consideration on a Windows platform).
 	  Thanks to Justin Matthews (jmatthews@nuera.com) for his bugreport.
 	* Added some routines to RTPSession to get the local IP address and the
 	  port number of the sending socket.
 	* 'install' rule added to the makefile.
 	* Added the define 'RTP_SOCKLENTYPE_UINT'. See README.TXT for more
 	  information about this.

 2.1 (December 1999)
	* First release of jrtplib.
	* Added member functions of RTPSession to retrieve the used sockets.
	* Made the destination list faster by using a hash table.

 2.0 (August 1999)
 	* First decent implementation of RTP. Entirely rewritten since 1.0.

 1.0 (August 1999)
 	* First implementation of RTP. There were a lot of things that weren't
 	  quite right and the organisation of the classes was quite nasty.
 	  However, I learned a lot about RTP making this version, and so it
 	  allowed me to make a good start on version 2.0.
